        The base class for all Operators.

        Operators consist of a class inheriting from this class
        and need to specify their inputs and outputs via
        thei inputSlot and outputSlot class properties.

        Each instance of an operator obtains individual
        copies of the inputSlots and outputSlots, which are
        available in the self.inputs and self.outputs instance
        properties.

        these instance properties can be used to connect
        the inputs and outputs of different operators.

        Example:
            operator1.inputs["InputA"].connect(operator2.outputs["OutputC"])


        Different examples for simple operators are provided
        in an example directory. plese read through the
        examples to learn how to implement your own operators...
